## Anchorage Detection & Segmentation
### Introduction
This project will work with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to extract vessel mobility information, quantify the navigational risks associated with mobility behaviour at sea, and analyze AIS mobility patterns in order to express the likelihood of unsafe or dangerous situation in measurable terms such as probability, risk score, or categorical level.
