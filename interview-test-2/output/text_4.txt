Conclusion

The study showcases how a “Double Funnel Approach” through an ML data ingestion pipeline can be an
efficient screening tool to analyze, review and rank CCS potential using readily available unstructured data.
In this case, 490,000 pages of documents have been analyzed in 21 days to identify potential CCS
opportunities below Heidrun producing field, extended across the Froan basin. Additional analysis through
the “data target” may now be undertaken around Heidrun field on related wells, seismic and interpretation
data.

To conclude, such an analysis suggests the scalability and the cost effectiveness of the methodology for
rapidly addressing the requirements of new CCS capabilities to mitigate the impact of the Climate Change.
